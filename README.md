Product Description
---------------------   

An area where users can limit their search based on ways that researchers wish to share their expertise (see the top part of the attached document “Ways of providing service). As with the SPN directory, this list could be preceded by “List profiled professionals with an interest in:” Users would be allowed to select only one option per search. The page default would be for none of these options to be selected. There would have to be a “reset” button to allow users to deselect all options.
An area listing research areas, where users could check as many boxes as they wish. The attached document (“Keywords”) provides an updated list of research areas.
Performing a search will yield a list of profiles that match the search criteria (perhaps with a certain number of listing per page). These profiles would include each researcher’s name, institution, and research interests.
Clicking on one of these profiles will open a detailed research listing in a new tab. The listing will include the following information:
Name, title of main position through which person conducts or supervises research, institution, mailing address, email address, telephone number, professional website, program/department website
Research interests (detailed)
Areas in which person is willing to share expertise
Main types of graduate programs through which person supervises graduate students in research on sexual orientation and gender identity
Back to #1 above: If a researcher wishes to have a profile listing in the directory, then s/he would click the link on the first page. The link would take the researcher to a page similar to page 2 of the attached PDF document that asks the person to indicate agreement with statements for ethical reasons. People who agree with the statements will be taken to a form where they can provide information for their listing. People who disagree with the statements will be taken to a page where it is explained that listings cannot be provide to researchers who do not agree with the statements on the previous page. I suppose people could be directed to me for any questions or concerns.
The form that gathers information from research might be best divided into a few pages (e.g., one page for institutional and contact information, one page for research interests, one page for indicating ways one is willing to share expertise with others). I’m thinking it might make sense to ask people to provide a preferred user name and password in these forms. Ideally, an email message would automatically be sent to the person upon completion of the forms stating that their profile will be sent to the directory manager for approval. Also, in the ideal world, it would be possible for the manager to automatically generate messages upon approving (or not approving) a new profile. For approved profiles, the message would include a reminder of the user name and password, along with the manager’s contact info.
 
Now onto the attached documents:
The attached survey (PDF) is what we used to collect data from researchers. I now think that it is way too detailed. Here are some ways that I think it might be good to change the survey:
On p. 3, instead of “Type of Working Setting,” have “Main work setting in which you conduct or supervise research related to sexual orientation and gender identity”
Eliminate pp. 4-9, 16-18
Instead of getting info about contact info etc. at the end of the survey, get it near the beginning.
The attached “Keywords” document contains a better listing and grouping of research areas (to replace pp. 13-15 of the attachment survey document).
On p. 22, we listed a bunch of ways researchers might want to share their expertise with others. The attached document (“Ways of providing service”) provides an updated and reordered list that I think is better.
We probably should require researchers to indicate permission to list their info (see p. 22), but this might be best placed at the very end of the form. Also, instead of referring to the “chair of the Science Committee,” this area should refer to the “directory manager.”
The attached Word document listing research categories (“Keywords”) represents my reworking of the list appearing in the original survey. I’m still not sure if it makes sense to allow directory users to search on all of the subcategories since it may be hard to display them in a manner that looks professional and that is user friendly. Can you think of a way to make this work?
In the previous sections, I have described the attached Word document “Ways of providing service”
 
You also asked me to provide the Internet link to the other student’s efforts at making this directory. The main search page is here (http://cvalab.info/LGBTresearch/). A sample of a full researcher profile is here (http://cvalab.info/LGBTresearch/index.php?option=com_sobi2&sobi2Task=sobi2Details&catid=2&sobi2Id=3&Itemid=). The form he created to gather researcher information is here (http://cvalab.info/LGBTresearch/index.php?option=com_sobi2&sobi2Task=addNew&Itemid=0).
